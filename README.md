# URG Lidar

This is a driver library for the Hokuyo URG Lidar sensor. Original code was
developed by Hokuyo; this repository contains a version modified by Husky
Robotics. Primarily, most changes are to clean up the repository and add CMake
build configuration.

The original README file can be viewed in `orig_readme.txt`. Note that the install
instructions there will no longer work.
